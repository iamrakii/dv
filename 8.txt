Filters remove all but the data you want to focus on.
Filter Pane: You can apply filters in the Filters pane, or make selections in slicers directly on the report page itself. The Filters pane shows the fields in individual visuals and any other filters the report designer adds.
There are four standard types of filters that you create in the Filters pane.
 Visual filter applies to a single visual on a report page. You see visual-level filters when you select a visual on the report canvas. Even if you can't edit a report, you can select a visual and filter it.
 Page filter applies to all the visuals on the report page.
 Report filter applies to all pages in the report.
