Steps:

 Browse to the location of vgsales.csv and open it.
 Data Preview:
 After loading, Tableau will show a preview of the data. You can rename columns if necessary.
 Click on the "Sheet 1" tab at the bottom to go to your first worksheet.

2. Tableau Terminologies:
 Dimensions: These are qualitative fields. In vgsales.csv, examples include Platform, Genre,and Publisher.
 Measures: These are quantitative fields used for calculations. Examples are Global_Sales, NA_Sales, and Year.
 Rows and Columns Shelf: Drag dimensions and measures to the Rows or Columns shelves to build the structure of your visualization.
 Marks: Controls the appearance of the data. You can set marks to be circles, bars, or other shapes and control size, color, and label.
 Filters: Used to limit the data displayed in the view.
 Pages Shelf: Used for creating animations or segmenting your view by categories.
3. Basic Functionalities:
a. Basic Visualization (Bar Chart of Global Sales by Genre):
 In your worksheet, drag Genre to the Columns shelf.
 Drag Global_Sales to the Rows shelf.
 You should see a bar chart. If the data isn’t aggregating correctly, check if the aggregation is set to SUM by right-clicking Global_Sales -> Measure -> Sum.
b. Sorting:
 Click on the Global_Sales axis and sort descending to show the genres with the most sales first.
c. Filtering:
 Drag Year to the Filters shelf.
 Choose the range of years you want to display (e.g., 2000-2016).
 Add Year to the Pages shelf to create a dynamic view of how sales changed over time.
4. Additional Functionalities:
Dashboards: Combine different sheets to create a comprehensive dashboard. Go to the Dashboard tab, drag your created sheets to the layout, and arrange them accordingly.
a. Add one more worksheet - Global Sales Trend by Year
